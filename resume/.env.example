# Environment Variables for AI Resume Builder
# 
# SECURITY WARNING: Never commit real API keys to version control!
# This is an example file showing required environment variables.
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local for local development
# 2. Replace 'your_gemini_api_key_here' with your actual Google Gemini API key
# 3. For Vercel deployment, add these variables in the Vercel dashboard
# 4. Make sure .env.local is in your .gitignore file

# Google Gemini AI API Key (Required)
# Get your API key from: https://ai.google.dev/
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Application URL (Optional - for production deployments)
VITE_APP_URL=https://your-app-name.vercel.app

# Development Notes:
# - The VITE_ prefix is required for Vite to expose variables to the client
# - Never share your actual API keys in code, documentation, or commits
# - Rotate your API keys immediately if they are accidentally exposed
